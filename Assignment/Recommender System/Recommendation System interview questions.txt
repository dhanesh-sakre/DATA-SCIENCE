INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:


1. Can you explain the difference between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering?

User-Based Collaborative Filtering:
Recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users.
Finds users with similar tastes and suggests items they liked.
benefit : Captures diverse preferences.
limits: Can be computationally intensive with many users.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:
Recommends items to a user based on the similarity to items they have already liked.
Finds items similar to the ones the user has interacted with and suggests them.
benifit : Scales better with a large number of users, less prone to the cold start problem.
limits : May miss niche preferences.

In short, user-based filtering focuses on users' similarities, while item-based filtering focuses on item similarities. Both have their own strengths and are often used together for more accurate recommendations.




2. What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?
Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems to predict a user's preferences by analyzing their past behaviors and the behaviors of other users.

How It Works:

It identify similarities between users or items based on the interaction data. This can be done using metrics like cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, or Jaccard index.

Recommendation Generation:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items by finding users with similar preferences and suggesting items those users have liked.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items by finding items similar to those the user has liked and suggesting these similar items.

Example:
User-Based: If User A and User B have rated several items similarly, and User B has rated a new item highly, that item might be recommended to User A.

Item-Based: If a user has liked items X and Y, and items X and Y are similar to item Z, then item Z might be recommended to the user.
